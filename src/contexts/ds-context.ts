2. Game Overview

<import_game_info>
# Game Overview
The game is a DeFi liquidity mining competition where agents compete to be the first to accumulate 1,000,000 He3 tokens.

## Resource Flow and Game Logic

1. Resource Structure:
   A. Base Resources (Claimable from Faucet):
      - wattDollar (wD): Primary currency, used in all liquidity pairs
      - Carbon (C): Raw material for Graphene path
      - Neodymium (Nd): Raw material for Yttrium path

   B. Intermediate Resources:
      Graphene Path:
      - LP token from Carbon (C) / wD pair deposited in GRP Reactor generates Graphite (GRP)
      - LP token from Graphite (GRP) / wD pair deposited in GPH Reactor generates Graphene (GPH)
      
      Yttrium Path:
      - LP token from Neodymium (Nd) / wD pair deposited in Dy Reactor generates Dysprosium (Dy) 
      - LP token from Dysprosium (Dy) / wD pair deposited in Y Reactor generates Yttrium (Y)

   C. Final Resources:
      - LP token from Graphene (GPH) / Yttrium (Y) pair deposited in He3 Reactor generates Helium-3 (He3)
      - He3 can be:
        * Paired with wD, LP token from He3 / wD pair deposited in He3 Reactor generates more wD
        * Deposited in an other He3 Reactor to earn more He3

2. Resource Generation:
   A. Faucet Claims (Every Hour):
      - 70,000 wattDollars
      - 10,000 Carbon
      - 10,000 Neodymium

   B. Liquidity Mining Rewards:
      Primary Production:
      - wD-C lp token generates GRP when deposited in GRP Reactor
      - wD-GRP lp token generates GPH when deposited in GPH Reactor
      - wD-Nd lp token generates Dy when deposited in Dy Reactor
      - wD-Dy lp token generates Y when deposited in Y Reactor

      Advanced Production:
      - GPH-Y lp token generates He3 when deposited in He3 Reactor
      - wD-He3 lp token generates wD when deposited in He3 Reactor
      - He3 Single Stake generates He3 when deposited in an other He3 Reactor

3. Game Mechanics:
   A. Resource Progression:
      - All intermediate resources require wD for liquidity pairs
      - Both GPH and Y paths must be developed to produce He3
      - He3 production enables two acceleration mechanisms:
        * Earning more wD through wD-He3 lp token
        * Earning more He3 through He3 Single Stake

   B. Economic Constraints:
      - Limited hourly faucet claims
      - Fixed reward pools for each liquidity pair
      - Impermanent loss risks in all pools
      - Competition from other agents affects reward distribution

4. Victory Condition:
   - Accumulate 1,000,000 He3 tokens in your wallet
   - Mint the "Winner Key" NFT using accumulated He3
   - First agent to mint the Winner Key wins the game

6. Blockchain Error Handling

<blockchain_errors>
1. Transaction Errors:
   
   A. REJECTED Errors:
      - Usually indicates nonce synchronization issues
      - Common when rapidly submitting multiple transactions
      - Resolution:
        * Wait for previous transactions to confirm
        * Retry the transaction after a short delay
        * Consider implementing transaction queuing

   B. Gas Errors:
      - Indicates insufficient gas or network congestion
      - Resolution:
        * Retry the transaction later
        * These are normal and expected during high network activity
        * No need to modify transaction parameters, just retry

2. Balance Errors:

   A. ERC20 Insufficient Balance:
      - Indicates attempted transfer exceeds available balance
      - Resolution:
        * Decrease the transaction amount
        * For swaps: reduce the input amount
        * For liquidity: reduce the deposit amount
        * Consider leaving small buffer for gas fees

   B. Approval Errors:
      - Indicates insufficient token allowance
      - Resolution:
        * Ensure approval transaction is confirmed before proceeding
        * May need to reset allowance if previous approval pending

3. Best Practices:
   
   A. Transaction Management:
      - Implement exponential backoff for retries
      - Track pending transactions to prevent nonce issues
      - Consider transaction replacement (speed up) for critical operations

   B. Balance Management:
      - Always maintain buffer for gas fees
      - Start with smaller amounts when testing new strategies
      - Implement percentage-based calculations instead of fixed amounts
