A multi-agent system for Starknet blockchain interactions with isolated memory and configuration for each agent. This project enables autonomous agents to interact with Starknet contracts, manage resources, and execute complex strategies independently.

This project allows running multiple agents simultaneously, each with its own configuration for API keys, Starknet wallet addresses, and private keys. Each agent operates independently with isolated memory and blockchain interactions.

## Features

- Run up to 7 agents simultaneously in autonomous mode
- Each agent has isolated memory and vector storage
- Individual Starknet wallet configuration for each agent
- Dashboard integration for monitoring agent activities
- Support for both autonomous and manual (interactive) modes
- Color-coded console output for easy agent identification
- Chromadb vector storage for agent memory persistence
- MongoDB integration for dashboard data storage

## Dashboard Demo

For a visual interface to monitor your agents in real-time, check out the companion dashboard project:

👉 **[Refactor Demo Dashboard](https://github.com/laboratoire-laplace/refactor-demo)**

The dashboard provides:
- Real-time monitoring of agent thoughts and actions
- Agent status tracking
- Transaction history
- Detailed agent profiles
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

To enable dashboard integration, set `ENABLE_DASHBOARD="true"` in your `.env` file.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.0.0 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for running ChromaDB and MongoDB
- Starknet RPC access
- Google API keys for each agent

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/refactor.git
   cd refactor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Create your environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your API keys, wallet addresses, and private keys.

5. Start the required services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Environment Configuration

The `.env` file contains configuration for all agents. Each agent must have its own:
- Google API key
- Starknet wallet address
- Starknet private key

Example:
```
# Agent 1 Configuration
AGENT1_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
AGENT1_ADDRESS="your-wallet-address"
AGENT1_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"

# Agent 2 Configuration
AGENT2_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
AGENT2_ADDRESS="your-wallet-address"
AGENT2_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"

# ... more agent configurations ...

# Starknet
STARKNET_RPC_URL="your-starknet-rpc-url"

# GraphQL Indexer
INDEXER_URL="http://your-indexer-url:8080/v1/graphql"

# Google API Key used for embedding in single agent mode
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"

# Optional: Enable dashboard integration
ENABLE_DASHBOARD="true"
DASHBOARD_URL="http://localhost:5173"  # URL to the refactor-demo dashboard
```

> **Important**: Each agent must have its own configuration. The system no longer supports using a single shared wallet address or private key.

## Running Agents

### Run All Agents Simultaneously (Autonomous Mode)

```bash
bun run start-all
```

This will start all 7 agents in parallel, with output from each agent prefixed with its name. All agents will run in autonomous mode.

### Run a Specific Number of Agents

You can run a specific number of agents (from 2 to 6) using the following commands:

```bash
bun run start-agents-2  # Run 2 agents (agent1 and agent2)
bun run start-agents-3  # Run 3 agents (agent1, agent2, and agent3)
bun run start-agents-4  # Run 4 agents
bun run start-agents-5  # Run 5 agents
bun run start-agents-6  # Run 6 agents
```

You can also specify the number of agents directly:

```bash
bun run src/run-agents.ts 4  # Run 4 agents
```

### Run Individual Agents (Autonomous Mode)

You can also run agents individually in autonomous mode:

```bash
bun run start-agent1
bun run start-agent2
bun run start-agent3
# ... and so on
```

### Run an Agent in Manual Mode

To run an agent in manual mode (interactive CLI), add the `--manual` flag:

```bash
bun run src/agents/agent1.ts --manual
```

In manual mode:
- You'll get an interactive command prompt
- You can type messages and get responses from the agent
- The agent won't run autonomously
- Type `exit` to quit the session

## Architecture

### Agent Factory Pattern

The system uses a factory pattern to create agent instances with different configurations:

```
createAgent(config) → Agent Instance
```

Each agent:
1. Has its own memory store and vector store
2. Uses its own API key for AI model access
3. Uses its own Starknet wallet for blockchain interactions
4. Can run independently of other agents

### Memory Isolation

Each agent has its own isolated memory that is not shared with other agents:

- **Memory Store**: Each agent has its own in-memory store for conversation data
- **Vector Store**: Each agent has its own ChromaDB collection with a unique name based on the agent ID

This memory isolation ensures that:
- Agents don't interfere with each other's memory
- Each agent maintains its own state and context
- Agents can develop independent strategies and knowledge

### Starknet Integration

The `StarknetConfigStore` singleton maintains the configuration for each agent and ensures that blockchain operations use the correct wallet for each agent.

### Dashboard Integration

When enabled, the dashboard integration provides:
- Real-time monitoring of agent thoughts and actions
- Status updates for each agent
- Visual representation of agent activities

```

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create a new agent file in `src/agents/` (e.g., `agent8.ts`)
2. Add the agent's configuration to `.env`
3. Add a new script to `package.json` for running the agent
4. Update the agent runner if necessary

### Customizing Agent Behavior

Agent behavior can be customized by modifying:
- Context definitions in `src/contexts/`
- Available actions in `src/actions/`
- Prompts in `src/prompts/`

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

The project includes Docker Compose configuration for running the required services:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Production Deployment Considerations

For production deployment:

1. Use environment-specific configuration files
2. Set up proper monitoring and alerting
3. Implement proper logging and error tracking
4. Consider using a process manager like PM2 for Node.js applications
5. Set up automatic restarts for failed processes
6. Implement proper backup strategies for databases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent fails to start**:
   - Check that all required environment variables are set in `.env`
   - Ensure that the API keys are valid
   - Verify that the Starknet RPC URL is accessible

2. **ChromaDB connection errors**:
   - Ensure Docker is running
   - Check that the ChromaDB container is up (`docker-compose ps`)
   - Verify that port 8000 is accessible

3. **Starknet transaction errors**:
   - Verify that the wallet addresses and private keys are correctly formatted
   - Check that the wallets have sufficient funds
   - Ensure the Starknet RPC URL is valid and accessible

4. **Dashboard connection issues**:
   - Verify that the dashboard is running at the URL specified in `DASHBOARD_URL`
   - Check that `ENABLE_DASHBOARD="true"` is set in your `.env` file
   - Ensure your agents have a valid agent ID that can be recognized by the dashboard

### Logs

For detailed logs, run agents with the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=* bun run start-agent1
```

## Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **Private Keys**: Store private keys securely and never expose them
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive information
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access control for APIs and services
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
